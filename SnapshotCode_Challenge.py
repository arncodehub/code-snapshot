"""
A regular map has the following interface methods:
get(k) -> v or KeyError
put(k, v)
delete(k)

We wish to augment this with two more methods:
take_snapshot() -> snap_id
get(k, snap_id) -> v or KeyError

take_snapshot captures the logical state of the map as of that point which can later be accessed via snap_id

get(.., snap_id) allows us to refer to the value of a key as of a historical snap_id.

Implement this data structure with following hard constraints:
values that have not changed across snapshots should not be duplicated 
All operations should be sub-linear in the size of the map (number of keys)

As a reference point for performance, imagine the map will have ~1 million keys, with ~100 snapshots, and 1% of the keys change in every snapshot.

Implement the methods besides delete first for simplicity, then return to implement delete if thereâ€™s time.

"""
	get(key) >> Takes in a key, return's it value in `data`
	put(key, value) >> Takes a key and value, adds it to `data`
	remove(key) >> Deletes that key from `data` along with its value
	get_snapshot_value(key, snapshot_id) >> Gets the historical value of a key in a stored snapshot NOT necessarily current `data`
	take_snapshot() >> Takes an immutable snapshot of the current `data`
	get_all_data_from_snapshot(snapshot_id) >> Gets ALL the data from a snapshot, not just changes

	IMPORTANT: The first snapshot must be ID 1, next is ID 2, etc.
	OR everything will fall apart and break down!!!

	Also, there is NO error handling, so do not delete nonexistent keys, 
	or add keys will value `None` this will break everything

	YOU MUST initialize the class 'SnapshotMap' with {}, {} as arguments FIRST
	or else it will not work
